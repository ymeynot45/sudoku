This was the first friday project at DBC. 
I worked with Jason Benn and Arron Dufal (sp? sorry.)

This was my first attempt, where we went with my favorite design structure of keeping it a string rather than tossing it into a series of arrays.

Currently it has no guessing options and I need to add that to solve the last and third to last probles as noted in the comments.
